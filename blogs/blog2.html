          Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically
          resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on
          all devices.

            The right mindset
            <p class="text-justify">
              Always remember that, even before you write a single line of CSS,
              the website is responsive and the layout is going to work on
              really big screens and really small screens, though it might not
              be pretty on really big screens as it might be kind of hard to
              read but the website adapts to the viewport no matter what you do.
              Understanding this can really help us out when we're writing our
              CSS. and this means that we just have to take a little bit of a
              different approach in getting things working.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Start with global styling
            <p class="text-justify">
              Before starting to work on the layout, setting up things like
              typography, colour and backgrounds can take the website far along.
              The layout might not look beautiful, but it will and won’t be
              broken at any point. This also helps in organising your CSS by
              keeping the common styling first.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid fixed sizes
            <p class="text-justify">
              Setting fixed height or a fixed width, will cause problems on
              smaller devices.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Setting the <em>width</em> of a block-level element will prevent
              it from stretching out to the edges of its container. The problem
              occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the
              element, the browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.
              Using <em>max-width</em> instead, will improve the browser's
              handling of small windows as then it will be allowed to shrink if
              it gets smaller but, if it gets too big it’ll stick to that width.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Similarly, if you're setting a like 100 viewport height to setup a
              big hero area that needs to fill up the whole thing, setting it as
              a <em>min-height</em> will just solve potential problems that you
              might run into when you start going on to narrower viewports.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use media queries to add complexity
            <p class="text-justify">
              Media queries are a way to target browser by certain
              characteristics, features, and user preferences, then apply styles
              or run other code based on those things. It uses the
              <em>@media</em> rule to include a block of CSS properties only if
              a certain condition is true. Web pages with rows and columns often
              don’t look good on a small screen. Media queries can help with
              that. We can add a breakpoint where certain parts of the design
              will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint. But one
              thing that's really important is to try to avoid having too many
              break points and for a lot of designs we can get away with one or
              sometimes two break points, since a lot of times you can do
              general grouping.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Take advantage of modern CSS
            <p class="text-justify">
              By using more modern CSS approaches we won’t have to worry about
              break points as much, in fact some people also advice on avoiding
              to use breakpoints in the first place. For example, using
              <em>min()</em> and <em>max()</em> max() functions to set the
              smallest or largest value from a list of comma-separated
              expressions as the value of a CSS property. The
              <em>clamp()</em> CSS function clamps a value between an upper and
              lower bound. It enables selecting a middle value within a range of
              values between a defined minimum and maximum. It takes three
              parameters: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum
              allowed value.
