          Scalable Vector Graphics or SVG is an image format that’s like HTML
          for 2D graphics. The popular image formats (.png and .jpg) are raster
          images, that is they use a grid of tiny pixels to create an image.
          And, thus when we try zooming into the picture it starts to look
          grainy. On the other hand, vector images can be scaled to any size
          without losing their resolution, because instead of pixels its
          appearance is based on geometry. They are drawn from mathematically
          declared shapes and curves and such, so pixels are no limitation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The size of an SVG file depends on how complex it is and not on how
          "large" it is. As it doesn’t matter at what size the SVG is rendered.
          A 100×100 pixel raster image has 10,000 pixels of information, in
          contract SVG is just instructions on how to draw something and if
          these instructions are simple enough, they can be quite a bit smaller
          than having to store data on each pixel. There is no set formula to
          decide which format is more suitable, but it makes more sense to use
          vector for the following :
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Logos</li>
          <li>Icons</li>
          <li>Simple illustrations</li>
          <li>Charts</li>
          <li>Maps</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-justify">
          To use SVG as an image, we can simply do it using img tag.
        </p>

        <code class="code">&lt;img src="image.svg" alt="image"&gt;</code>
        <p class="text-justify">
          But, perhaps the best way to use SVG is Inline SVG – that is, putting
          SVG code right into your HTML. Since this way, there are no requests
          being made it’s faster and as it’s directly rendered into the DOM, we
          can affect it using CSS or JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          We can create SVGs with tools like Figma or illustrator or by writing
          the code directly.
        </p>
        <code class="code">
          &lt;svg viewBox="0 0 100 100"&gt;<br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&lt;rect x="10" y="10" width="20%" height="20%" /&gt;
          <br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&lt;circle /&gt;<br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&lt;polygon/&gt; <br />
          &lt;/svg&gt;
        </code>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Here, inside the SVG tag viewBox attribute is used to define a
          coordinate system that gives us a frame with a width and height of 100
          units, on which we can draw graphics like basic shapes by adding
          elements like rectangle circle and polygon. We can position the
          rectangle by defining its x-y value on the view box then give it a
          size that can be absolute or responsive values. We can change its
          color using the fill attribute and add an outline using the stroke
          attribute.
